# VolMixerOnWin11
Put pervious Volume Mixer to system tray on Windows11. 在Windows11的系统托盘上显示旧版音量合成器  

On Windows 11, the pervious Volume Mixer, which we have used for many years, is removed. It starts fast and does not take much space. The new Volume Mixer embedded in Settings replaces it, which not only takes a few seconds to start up but is not so intuitive. Despite disadvantages existing in pervious versions, I still fancy using it, thus creating the application so as to make the pervious System Volume Mixer accessible in Windows 11.  
Windows 11移除了旧版的音量合成器，引入了设置中的新版音量合成器。但是新版音量合成器无论是在响应速度还是直观性上都不如旧版，因而我开发了这个应用来快速调出旧版音量合成器。  

It seems that there are other repositories on GitHub that provide the function. However, their features do not satisfy me. This project starts with the basic function(to display pervious Volume Mixer button on system tray), which may be similar to other repositories'. Afterwards, I plan to try more features, like replace the system volume button. After all, displaying 2 volume icon takes too much room.  
似乎GitHub上已有其他提供这个功能的存储库，但其功能仍不够完善，且长期未更新。这个项目仍从相似的基础功能着手，但后续将加入更丰富的功能，以解决需要2个音量按钮的问题。
